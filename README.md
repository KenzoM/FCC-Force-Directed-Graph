# National Contiguity
A D3.js (**Version 4**) visualization app that demonstrates countries' contiguity (by land) using D3.js's Directed Graph.
## Getting Started

[Live Demo](http://kenzomendoza.com/FCC-Force-Directed-Graph/app/)

The app is based on one of [FreeCodeCamp's challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-national-contiguity-with-a-force-directed-graph).

It meets the following criteria

>User Story: I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.

>User Story: I can see each country's flag on its node.

This app was made possible by using [FCC's API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DealPete/forceDirected/master/countries.json)
